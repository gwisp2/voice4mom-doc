# Voice4mom

A mod that voices in-game texts in the Mansions of Madness companion app.
Requires internet access because text to speech conversion is done on the server.

**From the v1.4 requires [CultistToolbox](https://github.com/gwisp2/CultistToolbox) to be installed**.

## Changelog:

### v1.5
1. Fixes for some bugs related to future message prediction

### v1.4
1. Less reliance on internet connection latency and speed. voice4mom tries to preload some messages a long before they are actually shown.
2. CultistToolbox mod is now required to be installed. (used for prediction of random)
3. Audio files are cached now
4. This version was not officially released

### v1.3
1. Now you may disable the dubbing without deleting the mod. Install [ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) to enable/disable dubbing without restarting the game.
2. Fixed a bug where the second and the third attack buttons did not work sometimes

### v1.1
English language is supported now.
